# Stay---Your-one-and-only-hotel-app
# Introduction

This <a href="https://stay--hotel.herokuapp.com/">website</a> is an authenticated hotel add-view-review  web app where users can add, view or post a review on some hotels and can view reviews posted by other users. It is designed to provide users the complete information to where and how the hotels and provides the authenticity to add or review one/many of them.
It is originally designed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunjmanavadariya/">Kunj Manavadariya</a>.

## CPU- Scheduling:

1. FCFS: First Come First Serve is the full form of FCFS whihc is the easiest and most simple CPU scheduling algorithm.
	Implementing and getting results: Go to 'CPU scheduler-FCFS' by scrolling down on FCFS page. Enter comma separated valid input values for arrival time and burst time to get the full results in the tabular as well as graphical form.
	Location of HTML file: osvirtuallab-master/CPU_Scheduling/FCFS_CPU
	Location of JS file: osvirtuallab-master/Assets/js/CPU_FCFS
2. SJF: The shortest job first(SJF) scheduling is an algorithm which, in simple words, means that the shortest job gets executed first.
	Implementing and getting results: Go to 'CPU scheduler-SJF' by scrolling down on SJF page. Enter comma separated valid input values for arrival time and burst time to get the full results in the tabular as well as graphical form.
	Location of HTML file: osvirtuallab-master/CPU_Scheduling/SJF_CPU
	Location of JS file: osvirtuallab-master/Assets/js/CPU_SJF
3. SRJF: The Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling algorithm, the process with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute.
	Implementing and getting results: Go to 'CPU scheduler-SRJF' by scrolling down on SRJF page. Enter comma separated valid input values for arrival time and burst time to get the full results in the tabular as well as graphical form.
	Location of HTML file: osvirtuallab-master/CPU_Scheduling/SRJF_CPU
	Location of JS file: osvirtuallab-master/Assets/js/CPU_SRJF
4. Round Robin: Round Robin is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking.
	Implementing and getting results: Go to 'CPU scheduler-Round Robin' by scrolling down on Round Robin page. Enter comma separated valid input values for burst time and time quantum to get the full results in the tabular as well as graphical form.
	Location of HTML file: osvirtuallab-master/CPU_Scheduling/RoundRobin_CPU
	Location of JS file: osvirtuallab-master/Assets/js/CPU_RR
5. Priority scheduling: Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. 
	Implementing and getting results: Go to 'CPU scheduler-Priority schduling' by scrolling down on Priority scheduling page. Enter comma separated valid input values for burst time, arrival time and priority to get the full results in the tabular as well as graphical form.
	Location of HTML file: osvirtuallab-master/CPU_Scheduling/Priority_CPU
	Location of JS file: osvirtuallab-master/Assets/js/CPU_Priority

Comparison between algorithms (CPU scheduling) step-by-step:<br>
Step-1: Click on 'Compare' button in the nav bar.<br>
Step-2: Enter comma separated valid input values for arrival time, burst time, priority and time quantum to get comparison of all 5 algorithms on basis of avg turn around time and avg waiting time in tabular as well as graphical form.
